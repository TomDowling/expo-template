# Expo Template (expo-template)
This is a simple expo template. Trying to keep the core of this repo up-to-date with the expo releases it has a few extra modules out-the-box to help you get going faster.

Something different is the folder structure, I have made it more consistent to a React application so that the structure can be shared across both.

`N.B. This Repo is in Typescript`

## Modules
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
